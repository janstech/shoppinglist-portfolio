# UI & State Management

The UI is implemented entirely with Jetpack Compose and Material 3.

## UI Principles

- Declarative UI
- Single source of truth
- Predictable recomposition

## State Handling

- ViewModel-scoped state
- No business logic in composables
- Clear separation between UI and domain logic

## Accessibility

- Material 3 color contrast
- Touch target sizing
- Voice input support

The UI layer is optimized for clarity, performance, and accessibility.
